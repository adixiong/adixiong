👋 Hi, I’m Adi Xiong. I'm a Freelance Developer and a CS student from Phoenix, Arizona (GO SUN DEVILS!) 👋

🌱 I’m currently working on improving and updating multiple projects, including Torchie.io. 🌱

📫 You can reach me through my LinkedIn or through my email, adixiong@outlook.com. 📫 

✨ When I'm not coding, I love making digital art, travelling, hiking, skiing, and go-kart racing.
